## How?

### Work Queue

A list of the tasks that need to be performed next.
The work-queue is stored as a **Sorted Set** where the **timestamp** (when the task was added to the work-queue) is the "**score**" and the value is the  **url** that needs to be crawled.

```js
[
  'https://github.com/dwyl 1438948333290',
  'https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/people 1438948467205',
  'https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015 1438948491989'
]
```

**Q**uestion: should we add all links on a page to the work queue immediately
***or*** only add links to the queue as we find them?  
**A**: I think we need to add all related links to the queue *immediately*
to ensure that we get content-complete as quickly as possible.
